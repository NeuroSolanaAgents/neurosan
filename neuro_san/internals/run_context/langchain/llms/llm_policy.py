    Policy interface to manage the lifecycles of web clients that talk to LLM services.
    This inherits from EnvironmentConfiguration in order to support easy access to the
    get_value_or_env() method.

    There are really two styles of implementation encompassed by this one interface.

    1) When BaseLanguageModels can have web clients passed into their constructor,
       implementations should use the create_client() method to retain any references necessary
       to help them clean up nicely in the delete_resources() method.

    2) When BaseLanguageModels cannot have web clients passed into their constructor,
       implementations should pass the already created llm into their implementation's
       constructor. Later delete_resources() implementations will need to do a reach-in
       to the llm instance to clean up any references related to the web client.
